# mySpaceMemoryHypothesis

- All events and history on Earth spread out into space through light. (Visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, electromagnetic wave)

- So, theoretically, you can see all the past history of the earth when you ride a space ship faster than the light.

- Therefore, space is not an empty space, but a huge storage medium (Memory, HDD) that stores massive history information.

- The universe is so huge that it is a waste of space, but in reality it is not empty but it is full of data.

- And the planets correspond to CPUs that produce various events and historical data.

- So what are the stars? And plays the role of Main Power that supplies energy to each planet (CPUs).

- So each solar system is a huge computer that performs a history simulation.

- Massive historical data from various stellar systems (computers) are being superimposed on space and stored in fringe patterns.

- God may be looking at it like a hologram outside the cosmic borders. (I would not mind mentioning God, I'm not a believer, but I think I'll get it wrong.)

- The cause of the universe expansion is to increase memory by increasing the amount of history data.
